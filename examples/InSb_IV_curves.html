        <p>In the 
        following, we present some IV curves calculated by means of Archimedes. 
        These curves show the electric features of an quantum well InSb FET (Field 
        Effects Transistor). The structure of such a device is schematically 
        reported in the following picture.</p>
        <p class="center">

        <p class="nocenter">Starting from the top of the device, we have a 20 
        nanometers Al<sub><span style="font-family: verdana">0.2</span></sub>In<sub>
        <span style="font-family: verdana">0.8</span></sub>Sb 
        layer with the Source (Ohmic contact), the Gate (Schottky contact) and 
        the Drain (Ohmic contact again). Then we have the InSb quantum well with 
        a thikness equal to 50 nanometers. Finally, we find a 0.5 micron Al<sub>

        <span style="font-family: verdana">0.8</span></sub>Sb 
        again along with a Schottky contact with an applied potential equal to 
        -0.5 Volt (also known as the bulk potential).</p>
        <p class="nocenter"><b><i>Archimedes is well suited for such 
        heterostructures since it is able to quantum mechanically calculate the 
        transmission and reflection coefficient for the particles at such 
        heterojunctions.</i></b></p>
        <p class="nocenter">Varying the applied potential on the various contacts of 
        this device, it is possible to calculate its IV curves. This has been 
        done by means of Archimedes, our 2D semiconductor device simulator.</p>
        <p class="nocenter">In the following we report three IV curves obtained by 
        Archimedes, with the following applied potentials :</p>
        <p class="nocenter">Vsource = 0.0, Vbulk = -0.5, Vgate = -0.2, 0.0, +0.2, 
        Vdrain = from 0.0 to 0.5</p>

        <p class="nocenter">Finally, we report the following IV curve obtained by 
        Archimedes, with the following applied potentials:</p>
        <p class="nocenter">Vsource = 0.0, Vbulk = -0.5, Vgate = from -0.5 to +0.5,
